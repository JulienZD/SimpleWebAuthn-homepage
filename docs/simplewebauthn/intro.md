## Overview

The SimpleWebAuthn project contains two complimentary libraries to help reduce the amount of work
needed to incorporate WebAuthn into a website. The following packages are maintained here:

- [@simplewebauthn/server](packages/server.md)
- [@simplewebauthn/browser](packages/browser.mdx)

An additional package is also included that contains shared TypeScript definitions:

- [@simplewebauthn/types](packages/types.md)
